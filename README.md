[Abstract Meaning Representation of Turkish](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering/article/abstract-meaning-representation-of-turkish/35E839E5AF1F7B9F6BF16275A44BB71D) accepted for publication in [Natural Language Engineering](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering), Cambridge Press.

Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a graph-based sentence-level meaning representation. Although it is originally designed for English, its adaptation to non-English languages is possible by defining language-specific divergences and representations.  We introduce the first AMR representation framework for Turkish; agglutinative, free constituent order, morphologically highly rich. Besides this main contribution, the article also presents the construction of the first AMR corpus of 700 sentences, the first AMR parser (i.e., a tree-to-graph rule-based AMR parser)

## About

This guideline provides our Turkish AMR annotation schema. 
In [turkish-amr.md](https://github.com/amr-turkish/turkish-amr-guidelines/blob/main/turkish-amr.md) Turkish samples and Turkish specific AMR constructions are provided.

## Resources

- For the explanation of the general AMR concepts, the reader is directed to the English AMR guidelines [amr-guidelines](https://github.com/amrisi/amr-guidelines/blob/master/amr.md)  by provided links.
- Turkish AMR uses [Turkish Propbank](https://turkishpropbank.github.io/) for the predicates.
